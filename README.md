# Vimsizer #

Vimsizer is a simple plugin that was inspired by the [Firesizer]() extension for Firefox. This plugin gives you the ability to define a re-usable set of window dimensions. There are two default sizes that are defined:

    let g:window_sizes = {"normal": "XXX XX", "bigger": "XXX XX"}

These can be overriden or extended by using that variable.
